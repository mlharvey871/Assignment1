  <h1> Personal Profile </h1>
<h3> Online tests: </h3>
<p>1. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test (16Personalities, 2021) </br>
2. Learning Styles Test (PersonalityMax, 2021) </br>
3. Multiple Intelligences Test (PersonalityMax, 2021)  </br> </p>
<h3> What do these results mean? </h3>
<p>The results of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test (MBTI) determined that my personality
type is referred to as an ‘Advocate’. This test determined that I am introverted, assertive and
an intuitive thinker. My unique personality traits make me complex but also quite versatile
(16Personalities, 2021). The results determined that I confident in myself, passionate about
my interests and ideas, and diplomatic when dealing with conflict. Overall, I see these results
as supporting my belief that I enjoy being by myself, but I also possess the caring empathetic
nature required to spend time with other people. </p>
<p> The results of the Learning Styles Test determined that I am predominantly a kinaesthetic
learner, however the balance is very close between the three learning styles (kinaesthetic,
visual, and auditory). The results state that I prefer ‘hands-on’ experiences, however I am
equally capable learning through listening, viewing videos and reading texts. The Multiple
Intelligences test is based on Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences that states
that we all excel with different types of intelligences (PersonalityMax, 2021). The results of this
test were also quite balanced; however, my top three intelligences were intrapersonal (learn
independently and through reflection), logical (use logic and reason) and kinaesthetic
intelligence (learn through movement and experimentation). I believe that the three tests
clearly show that I can learn (and interact with others) in different ways, however my natural
tendency is to work alone.</p>
<h3> What influence do these results have on teamwork and collaboration?</h3>
  <p> The results of all three tests determined that I have an introverted personality and generally
try to avoid group work. I have the ability to be a leader, however I often avoid group-based
situations. The tests also determined that ‘learning new skills’ is important to me, and it is my
opinion that my desire to succeed will ensure that I push myself to work in groups and
collaborate with other students (even if I am not comfortable with these situations). My
respectful and diplomatic nature will be well suited to group projects as I possess the ability to
listen to the ideas and opinions presented by other people, as well as the ability to share
responsibilities. </p>
<h3> What do the results suggest should be considered when forming a team? </h3>
  <p> When forming a team, I need to consider both my strengths and weaknesses. I need to
understand that group-work and collaboration are an important part of the IT industry, and
there will be times when I need to complete tasks that make me feel slightly uncomfortable. It
will be important for me to get to know my fellow group members as soon as possible to
alleviate any anxiety. I will need to ensure that I demonstrate the strengths of my ‘Advocate’
personality, such as my passion, creativity, and insightful nature (16Personailities, 2021).
Conversely, I also need to be aware of my weaknesses (and attempt to improve them) such
as my sensitivity to criticism and perfectionism. </p>
