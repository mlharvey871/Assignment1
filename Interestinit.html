  <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<p> I have had an interest in Information Technology (IT) for as long as I could remember. I grew
up in the 1990’s and always had access to a computer. One of my first memories was being
gifted an IBM XT computer (see Figure 2) and learning the basics of DOS. It was not overly common for people at this point in time to have personal computers, however
my father was heavily invested in the industry and wanting to start his own small business
relating to computer games and repairs. My father’s interest in IT certainly inspired me to enter
the field. He started his business venture by selling games (on floppy disks) at a local market,
before eventually opening a variety of stores (specialising either in video games or computer
repair). I spent a lot of my childhood at these stores, often testing out any new devices. </p>
<p> I have considerable experience with software applications such as those included in Microsoft
Office, and I also have a solid understanding of networking and operating systems. My
programming experience is limited to that of which I was required to teach to my primary school
students. I have only used ‘blocky’ code and some basic aspects of HTML. I consider my
problem-solving skills to be well-developed, and I was therefore often thrust into the role of ‘IT
support’ at many of the schools that I was employed by. I thoroughly enjoyed helping other
people and teaching them the basics of computer operation. One of my other IT-related
passions is 3D printing. I own five 3D printers of my own and used them to teach 3D design
to my previous students. </p>
<p> I see my future in a more creative role such as web design, software programming or even as
a computer technician. I was always keen to study a Bachelor of Information Technology, but
it was not until I knew that teaching was no longer for me, that I was brave enough to make 7
the decision to attempt further study. I chose to attend RMIT because of the school’s
tremendous reputation and the variety of online testimonials. I believe that the subjects that
form the degree will greatly assist me in reaching my career goals. I researched the university
in detail and was very impressed with their dedication to producing students that are ready for
the workforce (having obtained ‘in-demand’ skills). The option of completing the degree online
was also a major factor, as I find the flexibility essential to my current situation (caring for my
four children). </p>
<p> I expect to learn many different concepts throughout the duration of this degree. I expect to
learn a considerable amount of programming skills, both software-based and web-based.
There will undoubtedly be an emphasis on solving IT-related problems and synthesising
suitable solutions. I expect to learn about computer systems and IT security. I understand the
importance of teamwork and collaboration in the IT industry and expect numerous groupbased projects. Open Universities (2021) state that the aim is for students to develop
knowledge and skills essential for the information technology industry to enable them to be
employable as a competent software developer, web developer or other aligned IT
professional. My understanding is that I will be introduced to a variety of digital tools and
applications relating to computer programming and collaboration. </p>
