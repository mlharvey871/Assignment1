<p>My name is Mark Harvey (see Figure 1), and I am thirty-three years old. I live in Adelaide with
my wife and four children. I have previously completed a Bachelor of Education and worked
in the education industry for the last ten years (predominantly as a primary school teacher). I
enjoyed aspects of the job; however, I certainly lost some enjoyment over the past two years.
This led me to seek a career change, as well as exploring one of my greatest passions –
‘Technology!’ Another passion of mine is undoubtedly ‘sport’. I do not get a lot of time to play
any sports anymore, however I try to watch every game on television. I follow Essendon in
the AFL, Penrith in the NRL and Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premer League. I also
enjoy watching basketball, American Football, and cricket.</p>
