  <h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<p>I am interested in numerous aspects of IT and I would enjoy a career in either web design,
software development or technical support. With my background in education, I believe that
an ideal job (see Figure 3) for me would be as a Digital Content Designer/Builder (Seek, 2021).
This position would require me to design an education-based web site and then be responsible
for creating (and maintaining) a related Learning Management System (LMS). The position
would require me to create a complete digital system that enables students to enrol in a
specific course, access study materials and perform assessment tasks. I would need to ensure
that the web site and LMS are both visually appealing and easy to navigate. The position
would require me to work with course engineers and other stakeholders to ensure that all
design requirements are met (see Figure 4).</p>

<p>Digital Content Designers need to understand how users interact with content and make sure
that it meets user needs (Newson, 2019). This position appeals to me not only because of my
background in education, but also because of my desire to solve problems and utilise my
creative skills. I enjoy the challenge of being given a design brief and ensuring that my eventual
design meets the needs of the specific users. I believe that this position would allow me to be
creative with my designs, as well as being able to provide support to the people that eventually
use the programs. I would also have the opportunity to continue working on the project even
after it is launched, with a high likelihood of the prospect of being required to continue
designing updates and improvements to the LMS. A good LMS should make incremental
updates and keep up with industry trends (eLogic Learning, 2017).</p>
<p>The position (see Figure 5) requires the applicant to have experience designing and
developing multimedia learning-products (Seek, 2021). The applicant would be required to
demonstrate their ability to learning platforms either through a portfolio of previous designs or
recognised qualifications. The position requires the potential applicant to have experience with
graphic design and web site development, which will likely include a comprehensive
knowledge of programming languages. They will also need to have the ability to use a variety
of design tools and applications. The position requires strong User Interface (UI) skills and the
ability to follow a design brief using numerous UI design tools. UI design tools allow the
developer to develop a User Interface based on the design brief (Pedamkar, 2020). Perhaps
the most essential requirement for the position is a passion for great design and the ability to
be creative.</p>

<p>I currently possess only a limited understanding of programming languages and web design
tools. I have a passion for design and the ability to follow set guidelines. In my previous
positions, I have also demonstrated the ability to work as part of a team and collaborate with
others. It is likely that a position of this magnitude is currently out of my reach, therefore I
would need to develop a plan to obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience that the
potential employer requires. I believe that a Bachelor of Information Technology (with electives
in Web Design) would be a great starting point. I would then need to undertake further studies
in web design and computer programming. My options may include postgraduate study, a
Diploma of Web Design or even completing numerous online programming courses. The next
step would undoubtedly be compiling a portfolio of my designs to demonstrate my skills and
abilities, and conceivably learning to use UI design tools such as Adobe XD (see Figure 6).</p>
